## Installation
Firefox (Desktop + Android) - [AMO :: Trigger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/trigger/)

## About
Trigger is a browser extension. It gives you the power to create a collection of hotkeys that will work even if the browser is not focused. The browser must be running though.

This also works in Firefox for Android. Hotkeys here are variations of swipes, such as 5-finger swipe from left.
